# 2022-Conversion-Calculator

This one began life as an open ended problem for our top Y10 students to really challenge them.  The brief was to create a program that would allow users to convert things like mass, volume, distance and time.  Ideally we want the program to be easy to edit / update (it should be easy to add in additional units).

There are many ways of solving this problem.  Here is mine.  The complete program is in the file called 00_base.py - the other programs are the componenets that I used in the process of developing the calculator.
